This weeks post does not include that many visualisations or civic tech pieces but more local journalism with data visualisations. 

I'm still figuring out the best approach to it, and if you have any suggestions please let me know :) 

## Visualizations

### [NYC Street Tree Map](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/)

This one is not totally new but worth checking out and sharing. 

> The New York City Street Tree Map brings New York City’s urban forest to your fingertips. For the first time, you have access to information about every street tree in New York City. Learn about the trees that make up our city’s urban forest, mark trees as favorites and share them with your friends, and record and share all of your caretaking and tree stewardship activities.

### A History Of California Wildfires

Capital Public Radio (CPR) mapped wildfires have from the last 100-plus years in California.   
“A History Of California Wildfires,” uses data sets from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) (dating back to 1878), as well as the U.S. Geological Survey’s 2018 data set.

_I love maps as you might have realised and this one looks great. It's great that they included the source data and more information about its usefulness. 

But I do not like the color changes. Especially with fires you would assume that the red fires where the more severe but they're the most recent one. And overlaying all of them looks kinda weird. But if you scroll to the dates is pretty intense. I would have used a time slider and a play button to show the severity of the fires. And I would use one color for all of them.   
Maybe add a second color if you have more information to encode. Or add a heatmap to show the regions that are hit the hardest in the last 100 years. _ 

### Boston Neighborhood Change Interactive Map

> The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University has released a new Boston Neighborhood Change Interactive Map, which allows visualizations of demographic, social and economic changes in the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area.

They offer a recommended maps section which include maps about Racial and Ethnic Diversity, Modestly-Priced Homes and Gentrifying Neighborhoods. 

_I took a closer look at the Gentrifying Neighborhoods map. And it  took me some time to figure them out._
