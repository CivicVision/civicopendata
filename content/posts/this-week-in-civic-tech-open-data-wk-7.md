This week includes data visualisations about Trees in New York, Wildfires in California, Housing in Boston and Scooters in San Diego. 

I'm still figuring out the best approach to it, and if you have any suggestions please let me know :) 

## Visualizations

### [NYC Street Tree Map](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/)

This one is not totally new but worth checking out and sharing. 

> The New York City Street Tree Map brings New York City’s urban forest to your fingertips. For the first time, you have access to information about every street tree in New York City. Learn about the trees that make up our city’s urban forest, mark trees as favorites and share them with your friends, and record and share all of your caretaking and tree stewardship activities.

### A History Of California Wildfires

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/civicvision/image/upload/v1549898069/Volume%204/ca-fires.png)

Capital Public Radio (CPR) mapped wildfires have from the last 100-plus years in California.   
“A History Of California Wildfires,” uses data sets from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) (dating back to 1878), as well as the U.S. Geological Survey’s 2018 data set.

_I love maps as you might have realised and this one looks great. It's great that they included the source data and more information about its usefulness. 

But I do not like the color changes. Especially with fires you would assume that the red fires where the more severe but they're the most recent one. And overlaying all of them looks kinda weird. But if you scroll to the dates is pretty intense. I would have used a time slider and a play button to show the severity of the fires. And I would use one color for all of them.   
Maybe add a second color if you have more information to encode. Or add a heatmap to show the regions that are hit the hardest in the last 100 years. _ 

### Boston Neighborhood Change Interactive Map

> The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University has released a new Boston Neighborhood Change Interactive Map, which allows visualizations of demographic, social and economic changes in the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area.

They offer a recommended maps section which include maps about Racial and Ethnic Diversity, Modestly-Priced Homes and Gentrifying Neighborhoods. 

_I took a closer look at the Gentrifying Neighborhoods map. And it  took me some time to figure them out. They have the typical red, yellow green color scale, which makes it easy to spot good and bad parts. I would have wished more explanation. I clicked on Gentrifying Neighborhoods but I am not sure if a green or a red district is gentrified. here is a detailed screenshot of the map:_

_While I'm writing this, I realise this will be my second longer post diving into visualisations more deeply. Keep an eye out for those posts in the upcoming weeks._ 

### Motorized scooter tickets leap in San Diego

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/civicvision/image/upload/v1549898094/Volume%204/sd-scooter-violations.png)

A news article from the San Diego Union Tribune about scooter tickets in San Diego.   
San Diego saw a rise in Scooters and Scooter usage over the last year and I enjoyed riding the scooter there a lot :)   
The article includes three visualisations and a map. The map naturally caught my eye. 

_It's using Carto as a provider and therefore really great basemaps which help emphasise the data and not the streets. On a first glance at the map you can see that most tickets were issued downtown and most of the scooters are in downtown San Diego. So no surprise there. I would have loved seeing actually scooter usage numbers but we have to take what we get :)  
One thing that stands out and could confuse readers is the color choice. They used red, green, yellow and added a blue. But the colors do not match the ticket description very good. You would not expect a green dot being a scooter without adequate brakes. But I applaud the Union Tribune of using data analysis and visualisations to support their stories._ 

### Chicago Pre-K Community Programs

> El Valor runs the second-largest network of early childhood education centers in Chicago, after the public school system itself. Until this fall, several of its centers on the city’s South and Southwest sides had long waitlists.

This article is about the change of then Mayor Rahm Emanuel announcing that Chicago would embrace universal education for 4-year-olds. And community education Center El Valor struggles to fill its places. 

_I love the small multiples approach, showing seats filled at the public school and the community programs. The typical red, yellow, green color for empty to full works well and adding a fourth color in blue to show overcapacity works great. Especially since it stands out right away. The cited their source but I would have loved to look into the data myself, so a link to the source would have been even better._
