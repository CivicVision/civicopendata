Volume 3 of my weekly roundup of visualizations, news and tweets in Civic Tech. The week was packed with great civic visualisations and fewer articles. Topics include Snow Clearing in Canada, civil forfeiture in SC, Cincinatti Heroin Incidents and more.

## Visualizations

This week we had plenty of great civic data visualisations and data stories from newspapers. That really made me happy :smile:

### Snow clearing complaints in Warterloo

![Map of sidewalk snow complaints in Kitchener.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dx3VRxWVYAArgGq.jpg:large)

Mike ... did a visualization about sidewalk snow clearing complaints from 2008-2018 using Open Data from [City of Kitchener, Ontario, Canada](https://www.kitchener.ca)

This is a nice small and easy visualization from Open Data. And it also is a great starting point for discussions. As Mike pointed out

> This dataset must not be complete - only 807 complaints over a decade is at least an order of magnitude too small, considering a staff report said winter of 2015/2016 alone, which was 'unseasonably mild' had 902 complaints.

This is a common problem I see with Open Data. Although it is published it is not always complete nor clean.

### Polar Vortex

Nice visualization from Tim Wallace using GFS forecast data. It has gorgeous colours and almost looks like art. I would print this out and hang it on the wall.

And there are plenty more where this awesome thing came from:

### TAKEN: How police departments make millions by seizing property

Anna Lee and Nathaniel Cary and Mike Ellis from _The Greenville News_ spent 2 years reporting and looking at every civil forfeiture in SC.

It is a great article, very lengthy and very detailed. It has some visualisations in it but they're more hidden. You need to click on the dots of the map to see them.

_I would have loved if they would include those graphs into the story because they're very powerful. And they're very clean as well which makes them easy to read and to understand._

_One critique that I have is that the map does not include Attribution where the data/basemap is coming from._

### Cincinatti Heroin Incidents

Recent work done with Mapbox in Tableau Public by Allan Walker (@AllanWalkerIT) for the Cincy Tableau User Group meeting. 

It is a really nice starting point to lead a discussion and that seems to be the intend as suggested in their tweets. 

I could not find the source dataset, but they said in that (embedded below) tweet it was using Open Data, so I suspect this would an Open Dataset published by the City of Cincinatti. 

It seems to be data from 2016 - 2019 buit again, no detailed information was provided.

### 1 in 12 shops closed in five years: England, UK

> 88 major town centres across England and Wales were included in the Guardian’s analysis of Ordnance Survey data.

This is a very nice and well rounded data story with nicely done visualizations that help uinderstand the problem of declining shops in England.
What I think really stands out is the added section at the end of the article about their Methodology. I think everybody should include that (myself included).

### How Los Angeles Controller Ron Galperin Brings Data to Life

Some awesome quotes from him and the article on Socrata's Blog.

> Galperin’s mission is to bring that data to life.

What a great statement and this should be ingrained in every government.

> Galperin focused on _The Three Ts_— transparency, trust, and transformation.

They mapped a year of domestic violence reports and the result was a change in Policy. Before the domestic violence programs were underfunded, disjointed, and inconsistent, after his effort:

> “We all have an incentive to try to do something about it,” he said. “Today we do have a domestic abuse response team in every police division.”

> “We’re trying to do more than just look at numbers, but also how we present it,” Galperin said.

### New York City, St. Petersburg, Fla., Ramp Up Data Storytelling

The city of St Petersburg Florida was using mapping to find areas where the most code violations were occuring. Using storytelling they were able to show wordload of code investigators and get upper-level buy-in. The result was a redraw of the districts to make besser use of resources.

> Better software has made the job of interpreting and analyzing city data easier.
