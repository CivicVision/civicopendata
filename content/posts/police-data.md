# Police data sources

There were a lot of reports in the last couple of months using police datasets or FOIA data. 
Here is a collection of the latest round with some comments from myself about the use of visualizations.

## [LAPD stop and frisk](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-lapd-traffic-stops-20190124-story.html?utm_content=buffer1cd9a&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=buffer)

### [The Cities Where The Cops See No Hate](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/hate-crimes-miami-police-irving-syracuse)

using FOA requests.

### **Fatal and non-fatal gun crime.** 

> On Thursday, Sarah Ryley, Sean Campbell, and I published [a deeply-reported investigation into U.S. cities’ failure to solve shootings](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/data-is-plural/data-is-plural-2019-01-30-edition/13579937-www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahryley/police-unsolved-shootings?c=2ac11ac4-b7f1-4897-b37a-987161fbd027) — a year-long collaboration between [The Trace](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/data-is-plural/data-is-plural-2019-01-30-edition/13579941-www.thetrace.org/?c=2ac11ac4-b7f1-4897-b37a-987161fbd027) and [BuzzFeed News](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/data-is-plural/data-is-plural-2019-01-30-edition/13579945-www.buzzfeednews.com/?c=2ac11ac4-b7f1-4897-b37a-987161fbd027). To reach [our quantitative findings](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/data-is-plural/data-is-plural-2019-01-30-edition/13579949-www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahryley/5-things-to-know-about-cities-failure-to-arrest-shooters?c=2ac11ac4-b7f1-4897-b37a-987161fbd027), we analyzed (and standardized) [three major FBI datasets](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/data-is-plural/data-is-plural-2019-01-30-edition/13579953-github.com/the-trace-and-buzzfeed-news/federal-crime-data-analysis?c=2ac11ac4-b7f1-4897-b37a-987161fbd027), [internal data from 22 police departments](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/data-is-plural/data-is-plural-2019-01-30-edition/13579957-github.com/the-trace-and-buzzfeed-news/local-police-data-analysis?c=2ac11ac4-b7f1-4897-b37a-987161fbd027), and [a database of Baltimore victims and suspects](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/data-is-plural/data-is-plural-2019-01-30-edition/13579961-github.com/the-trace-and-buzzfeed-news/baltimore-shootings-analysis?c=2ac11ac4-b7f1-4897-b37a-987161fbd027).

> Last year, The Washington Post published [Murder with Impunity](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/data-is-plural/data-is-plural-2019-01-30-edition/13579969-www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/where-murders-go-unsolved/?c=2ac11ac4-b7f1-4897-b37a-987161fbd027), a series examining unsolved homicides; their data, on 52,000+ homicides in 50 cities, is also [available on GitHub](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/data-is-plural/data-is-plural-2019-01-30-edition/13579973-github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides?c=2ac11ac4-b7f1-4897-b37a-987161fbd027).

### [Shoot Someone In A Major US City, And Odds Are You’ll Get Away With It](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahryley/police-unsolved-shootings)

> _This story was reported in partnership with_ [_The Trace_](https://www.thetrace.org/features/murder-solve-rate-gun-violence-baltimore-shootings)_, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to reporting on gun violence._

From the UK using FOIA requests

### Police response time

> All police forces to respond to FOI requests have seen 999 \[_911_\] response times increase - with some doubling since 2010

I like the choice of color for missing data and "no taget set". 

I do have some critique though:  
The headline **"Every police force has seen response times increase in recent years"** does not match the visualisation. The increase for everyone is not visible at first, if you dig deeper and look at the times, then you can see it. But highlighted are if they hit their target (which are probably self (angelegt).

Recently a lot of police datasets where released as Open Data. Which is very good so journalsists and civic advocacycy groups can dive into the data and hold the police accountable.

## And they did!

Since the release or due to the reporting ( you never know which was first ) a lot of articles where released using police data.
