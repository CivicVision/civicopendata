### Snow clearing complaints in Warterloo

sidewalk snow clearing complaints from 2008-2018 using Open Data from [City of Kitchener, Ontario, Canada](https://www.kitchener.ca)

This is a nice small and easy visualization from Open Data. And it also is a great starting point for discussions. As Mike pointed out 

> This dataset must not be complete - only 807 complaints over a decade is at least an order of magnitude too small, considering a staff report said winter of 2015/2016 alone, which was 'unseasonably mild' had 902 complaints.

This is a common problem I see with Open Data. Although it is published it is not always complete nor clean.
