In Volume x of my weekly roundup I stumbled across this interesting dataset about Child care cost in the bay area.

Here is the graphic that I looked at:

I thought this visualisation could be improved to bring the point across more clearly. 

A slope chart would be a great option.

> A slope graph can be used to show a ‘before and after’ story of different values, based on comparing their values at different points in time. The related values are connected by slopes.
