This week seem to be a slow week in visualizations and articles. But still there were some interesting pieces. They mostly relate to transit but all cover different angles. We have Subway desserts in NY, runner data displaying segregation in Baltimore and a new way to visualize transit trips.

## Visualizations

### **Where the Subway Limits New Yorkers With Disabilities - The New York Times**

I‘m a sucker for maps. And especially the ones designed by the NYT. They have a great visualization team.

And dessert maps (as I refer to this kind of maps) always make me smile. Although they typically are very sad maps since they show the lack of access to something.

**Takeaway**:  
**If you have the space use annotations to highlight certain areas and add explanations.**

### **Baltimore’s So Segregated, Even Strava Shows It. These Runners Want to Change That**

> And astonishing that you can see the segregation in running data.When viewing the Strava heatmap of Baltimore, the most-run routes of the city meld to form the outline of a letter “L” that glows like neon. It begins in the north and runs straight down the city’s spine, before diverting east along the Inner Harbor and the promenade. This area of Baltimore is also a demographic phenomenon known as “the white L.” It’s the area where resources are directed, where prospective homebuyers are guided and luxury apartment complexes are erected. Its lines are as obvious in real life as they are on the Strava heatmap, and most people who live inside of it stay inside of it.

_Nice heatmap of strava runners in the city of Baltimore. And astonishing that you can see the segregation in running data.  
Nothing too fancy about the map. And there are more where this is coming from._

**Takeaway:  
Heatmaps work best if you don’t show the underlying city or if you need to because the data does not cover much of the city make it light.**

### **Taxi Trips NYC**

Another nice looking heatmap. You can almost see the segregation in NY as well as you have seen in the runners map. It‘s not as obvious as the other but still visible. It is an old article that last week popped up again.

### **New way to visualize Public transit routes**

> According to research, travel preferences vary among urban commuters; some want to take the fastest route, some prefer to have the least walking or minimized interchanges, yet others prefer minimal waiting outdoors. Thus our challenge is to visualize and present transportation possibilities on smartphones according to the passenger’s needs.

The article behind this new approach is fascinating and worth a read. It is not specifically for Civic Tech but visualizing public transit is a challenge and I love the result that they came up with.
