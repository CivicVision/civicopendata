### [Chicago Middleclass is shrinking](https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/the-middle-class-is-shrinking-everywhere-in-chicago-its-almost-gone/e63cb407-5d1e-41b1-9124-a717d4fb1b0b?utm_source=&utm_medium=&utm_campaign=)

WBEZ Radio Chicago uses data and graphs from the _Nathalie P. Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement_ at the University of Illinois at Chicago to produce an article with the title: **"The Middle Class Is Shrinking Everywhere — In Chicago It’s Almost Gone"**

What I liked about the whole article is that they have explanations baked into it. For example: _what is the middle class?#  
I'm missing the methodology of the maps the center produced. The income levels are weighted income levels relative to seven country metro areas. But no explanation beyond that.  
And if you look at the last map they produced it shows a different picture. 29% of tracts are considered City 2 (Income level increase or decrease of less than 20%)._

**Takeaway**:  
**Methodology is an important part of your project for others to understand your visualization.**

### [Honululu Dashboard](http://www.honolulu.gov/dashboard)

> The Honolulu Dashboard monitors performance data in four priority areas: Homelessness, Affordable Housing, Streets and Lights, and Kākou for Parks.
>
> Ultimately, Mayor Caldwell’s major priorities and other selected community interests will be tracked on Honolulu Dashboard. This site provides an "at-a-glance" view of these topic areas.

This is a great use of civic tech. A dashboard that let's you and the mayor look at key indicators and the performance of the city. It increases transparency and allows to measure the city on the issues the mayor itself prioritized. And I'm a fan of dashboards that increases transparency and only focusses on one number.

**Takeway:  
Dashboards should be clear and one number is usually enough.**

### [Low Density Zoning Chicago](https://twitter.com/stevevance/status/1097708462748905473)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/civicvision/image/upload/v1551023847/Volume%206/zoning-chicago.jpg)

A map from [Steven Vance](https://twitter.com/stevevance/status/1097708462748905473) who usally creates great maps for Chicago. This one is about density zoning. As you can see on the map most of the city is red (low density zoning) and only a few parts of the city is green (aka allows condos and appartements).

_This map paints a clear picture and probably show the authors opinion. The color choices, red for low density and green for high density indicates to me that the author likes to see more high density zones_. _The legend is clearly marked and available. It's only a picture but I would have liked to state the data source. I assume it's an open dataset from the city of Chicago._ 

**Takeaway:  
You can guide or even influence your audience with your color choices.** 

### [Response Outreach Area Mapper](https://gis-portal.data.census.gov/arcgis/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=64f6a4d47e864b9699af6ce6338d49bd)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/civicvision/image/upload/v1551026481/Volume%206/response-outreach-mapper.png)

> The Census Bureau has released an online tool called ROAM (Response Outreach Area Mapper), an application that uses American Community Survey data to measure how hard-to-count each census tract might be, assigning each a score. Now cities and states are building on top of that base with local insight.


### [Homicides Baltimore](https://homicides.news.baltimoresun.com/)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/civicvision/image/upload/v1551006511/Volume%206/homicide-baltimore.png)

A Dashboard from the Baltimore Sun about homicides in Baltimore. And the corresponding [Article](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-homicide-record-numbers-20190222-story.html).

The cool thing about this is, they included the code for their analysis in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/baltimore-sun-data/2019-shootings-analysis).
