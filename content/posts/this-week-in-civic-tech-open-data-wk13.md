## Visualizations

### [London Arts Map](https://maps.london.gov.uk/cim/index.html)

> The collated data on the capital's cultural locations is hoped to support local authorities, property developers and associations develop existing clusters and build creative infrastructure

_This map is a great start and typically for these kind of maps, where you throw a lot of data at the user. The clusters are a good way to convey the right amount of information. But once you click further these symbols appear and make it really hard to see and read the map._

**Takeway: Be careful when to use symbols. Especially if you have a lot of data to show.**

### Mega Cities

_This is a great looking map with an interesting projection that serves the data well._

**Takeaway:   
Map Projections can help you display data differently and make data more readable.**

### [County profiles](https://ce.naco.org/)

**Takeaway:   
Sometimes your visualization needs more explanations. Make sure to include them.**
