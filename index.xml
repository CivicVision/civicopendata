      <description>Volume 3 of my weekly roundup of visualizations, news and tweets in Civic Tech. The week was packed with great civic visualiations and fewer articles. Topics include Snow Clearing in Canada, civil forfeiture in SC, Cincinatti Heroin Incidents and more.
Visualizations This week we had plenty of great civic data visualizations and data stories from newspapers. That really made me happy :smile:
Snow clearing complaints in Waterloo Mike Boos did an excellent visualization about sidewalk snow clearing complaints from 2008-2018 using Open Data from City of Kitchener, Ontario, Canada</description>

      <description>This is the first post of an effort I want to make to collect all interesting articles, visualizations and data releases from the last 7 days. I will publish them on Fridays here and will email them out.
This week has a lot of stuff in it because it is the first of the series. I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out how to divide the content into sections. If you have suggestions, please get in touch.</description>

      <description>What is this all about?
I searched for a place to share content I create or think about when working with Civic Open Data. I wanted to have a place where I can write about Open Data and Civic Tech as well as share Data Visualisations I created with Open Data.
This is the place I want to share it.</description>

      <title>Louisville Bird Data published</title>

      <description>The City of Louisville in Kentucky is the first city to publish Bird Scooter Data as CSV in their Open Data Portal. They updated their data three times already, so we should be in for a treat with monthly updates.
We have to thank the City of Louisville and Bird for releasing data so that we can finally study how people use scooters in cities.
This is just a partial analysis since we only have data for one city and only for a limited time frame.</description>

      <description>Update: Due to the government shutdown the API from data.gov does not respond.
While I was developing my government funded prototype „Automated City Open Data Census“ for Germany I was so deep into scrambling with metadata that I decided to take a closer look at the types and formats that get published.
So I used the CKAN API to get basic data from CKAN about licenses used, data formats and categories.</description>
