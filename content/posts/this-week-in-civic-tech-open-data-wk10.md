## Visualizations

### [Syracuse Snow Map](https://cityofsyracuse.github.io/snowmap/snowmap/snowplow_map.html)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/civicvision/image/upload/v1552111402/Volume%208/syracuse-snow-map.png)

What I love about this project is this comprehensive writeup of how they built it: [http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/snowplowmapdevelopment](http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/snowplowmapdevelopment "http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/snowplowmapdevelopment")

And everything is Open Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/CityofSyracuse/snowmap)

It would be great if they included the link to the explanation on the map somewhere. The colors, especially the one for "Not yet plowed" does not work great with the basemap. It's hard to see.  
The layer switcher should have a legend included, so the color of the lines should be next to the labels. And I would not turn on everything. Maybe start with the plowed streets and guide the user to click the others.

**Takeaway**:  
**Don't overload your map. Show the most important thing first and educate your user how they can find more.**

### [Atlas of Inequality](https://inequality.media.mit.edu)

> "Atlas of Inequality" a map of how unequal are places in our cities. Because economic inequality isn't just limited to neighborhoods. The restaurants, stores, and other places we visit in cities are all unequal in their own way.

This is a great looking map. The dot density style works really nice and they included a how to use the map right from the start:
