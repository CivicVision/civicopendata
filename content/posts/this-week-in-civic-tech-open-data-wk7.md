### Fighting Opioid Misuse by Monitoring Community Health

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/civicvision/image/upload/v1550335436/Volume%205/tempe-opiod.png)

This is a cool project by the city of Tempe, AZ using ArcGIS storymap and dashboard to explain opioids in waste water collection. 

_If you only look at the dashboard it is not immediately obvious why only three areas have graphs and three donâ€˜t. But if you read the story map it will be explainbed. My question with dashboards always is: Who is the audience. Is it the general public and is the dashboard to be used as a standalone project? Then a lot of explanations are missing. 
If it is for city workers and only shared for the sake of sharing and showing transparency I would argue that a dedicated dashboard for the public would be in order._

__Takeaway:__
Always ask yourself who is the audience of my visualization.
