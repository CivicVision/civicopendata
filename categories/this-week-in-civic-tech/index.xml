      <description>Volume 3 of my weekly roundup of visualizations, news and tweets in Civic Tech. The week was packed with great civic visualiations and fewer articles. Topics include Snow Clearing in Canada, civil forfeiture in SC, Cincinatti Heroin Incidents and more.
Visualizations This week we had plenty of great civic data visualizations and data stories from newspapers. That really made me happy :smile:
Snow clearing complaints in Kitchener Mike Boos did an excellent visualization about sidewalk snow clearing complaints from 2008-2018 using Open Data from City of Kitchener, Ontario, Canada</description>

      <description>This is the first post of an effort I want to make to collect all interesting articles, visualizations and data releases from the last 7 days. I will publish them on Fridays here and will email them out.
This week has a lot of stuff in it because it is the first of the series. I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out how to divide the content into sections. If you have suggestions, please get in touch.</description>
