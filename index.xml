      <description>What is this all about?
I searched for a place to share content I create or think about when working with Civic Open Data. I wanted to have a place where I can write about Open Data and Civic Tech as well as share Data Visualisations I created with Open Data.
This is the place I want to share it.</description>

      <description>The City of Louisville in Kentucky is the first city to publish Bird Scooter Data as CSV in their Open Data Portal. They updated their data three times already, so we should be in for a treat with monthly updates.
We have to thank the City of Louisville and Bird for releasing data so that we can finally study how people use scooters in cities.
This is just a partial analysis since we only have data for one city and only for a limited time frame.</description>
