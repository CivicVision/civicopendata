## Visualizations

### Snow clearing complaints in Warterloo

sidewalk snow clearing complaints from 2008-2018 using Open Data from [City of Kitchener, Ontario, Canada](https://www.kitchener.ca)

This is a nice small and easy visualization from Open Data. And it also is a great starting point for discussions. As Mike pointed out

> This dataset must not be complete - only 807 complaints over a decade is at least an order of magnitude too small, considering a staff report said winter of 2015/2016 alone, which was 'unseasonably mild' had 902 complaints.

This is a common problem I see with Open Data. Although it is published it is not always complete nor clean.

### Polar Vortex

Nice visualization from Tim Wallace using GFS forecast data. It has gorgeous colours and almost looks like art. I would print this out and hang it on the wall.

### How Los Angeles Controller Ron Galperin Brings Data to Life

Some awesome quotes from him and the article on Socrata's Blog. 

> Galperin’s mission is to bring that data to life.

What a great statement and this should be ingrained in every government. 

> Galperin focused on _The Three Ts_— transparency, trust, and transformation.

They mapped a year of domestic violence reports and the result was a change in Policy. Before the domestic violence programs were underfunded, disjointed, and inconsistent, after his effort: 

> “We all have an incentive to try to do something about it,” he said. “Today we do have a domestic abuse response team in every police division.”

> “We’re trying to do more than just look at numbers, but also how we present it,” Galperin said.
