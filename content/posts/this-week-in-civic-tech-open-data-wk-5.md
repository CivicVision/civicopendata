## Visualizations

### Snow clearing complaints in Warterloo

sidewalk snow clearing complaints from 2008-2018 using Open Data from [City of Kitchener, Ontario, Canada](https://www.kitchener.ca)

This is a nice small and easy visualization from Open Data. And it also is a great starting point for discussions. As Mike pointed out

> This dataset must not be complete - only 807 complaints over a decade is at least an order of magnitude too small, considering a staff report said winter of 2015/2016 alone, which was 'unseasonably mild' had 902 complaints.

This is a common problem I see with Open Data. Although it is published it is not always complete nor clean.

### Polar Vortex

Nice visualization from Tim Wallace using GFS forecast data. It has gorgeous colours and almost looks like art. I would print this out and hang it on the wall.

And there are plenty more where this awesome thing came from:

### TAKEN: How police departments make millions by seizing property

Anna Lee and Nathaniel Cary and Mike Ellis from The Greenville News spent 2 years reporting and looking at every civil forfeiture in SC.

It is a great article, very lengthy and very detailed. It has some visualisations in it but they're more hidden. You need to click on the dots of the map to see them.

I would have loved if they would include those graphs into the story because they're very powerful. And they're very clean as well which makes them easy to read and to understand. 

One critique that I have is that the map does not include Attribution where the data/basemap is coming from.

Article

### How Los Angeles Controller Ron Galperin Brings Data to Life

Some awesome quotes from him and the article on Socrata's Blog. 

> Galperin’s mission is to bring that data to life.

What a great statement and this should be ingrained in every government. 

> Galperin focused on _The Three Ts_— transparency, trust, and transformation.

They mapped a year of domestic violence reports and the result was a change in Policy. Before the domestic violence programs were underfunded, disjointed, and inconsistent, after his effort: 

> “We all have an incentive to try to do something about it,” he said. “Today we do have a domestic abuse response team in every police division.”

> “We’re trying to do more than just look at numbers, but also how we present it,” Galperin said.
